Cardo is the best GTD plugin for Tiddlywiki5 ever IMO.

I tweaked the latest version a bit, with a fresher and more modern design. But I updated it I ran into a problem.

**To make sure it is not my tweaking I tried it with the original version but I get the same error.**

The latest Cardo version which can be found at <https://dyumnin.com/Cardo.html> runs on TiddlyWiki core 5.1.15.
I updatet this file on <https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html> and uploaded it to <https://xrizzy.github.io>.

When I open [xrizzy.github.io](https://xrizzy.github.io/#A%20Big%20Project%20Im%20Working%20On:%5B%5BA%20Big%20Project%20Im%20Working%20On%5D%5D%20%5B%5BDraft%20of%20'What%20is%20your%20next%20task...'%20by%20Joe%20Cardo%5D%5D%20%5B%5BWelcome%20to%20Cardo%5D%5D%20%5B%5BProject%20Features%5D%5D%20Sub-Projects%20%5B%5BProject%20Teams%20%26%20RACI%20Roles%5D%5D%20%5B%5BProgress%20Tracking%5D%5D%20%5B%5BStatus%20Updates%5D%5D%20%5B%5BTask%20Management%20Features%5D%5D%20%5B%5BTask%20Reminders%5D%5D%20Meetings%20%5B%5BAgenda%20Items%20%26%20Attendees%5D%5D%20%5B%5BPeople%20%26%20Conversation%20Tracking%5D%5D%20%5B%5BBook%20Library%5D%5D%20%5B%5BBook%20Notes%5D%5D%20Goals) I get this error message:

>**Internal JavaScript Error**

>**uncaught exception: Linked List only accepts string values, not dcb08717-3d17-4d9a-aad7-826a54bcf5df**

I am at a loss. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction.

Thank you in advance.
